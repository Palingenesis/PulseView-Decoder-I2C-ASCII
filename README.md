# PulseView Decoder I2C-ASCII

**I2C-ASCII** is a copy of **i2c** with a little different output.

**The difference is:**

    If the HEX value is between 0 and 127. then the ASCII charecter for that value will be shown.

*Also in this repositry is a copy of the original i2c decoder. I have changed the wording of the output to match my modified version.*
